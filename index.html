          <h2>Planting the Seeds of Creativity</h2>
          <p>
            Exploring creativity also allows children to inherit solid traits of
            disciplinary motivation that will inspire them as they grow older to
            learn the values of culminating a start to finish mentality through
            hard work and creative problem solving.

          <h2>Artist Mentors Can Help Guide Your Creative Career</h2>
          <p>
            Since the art world can be a tough industry to break into, having an
            artist mentor share their career path can be extremely beneficial.
            However, its important to note that an artist mentor is there to
            guide you, but not hold your hand through everything. A good artist
            mentor will show you the ropes, empower and equip you with the
            elements critical for success, and then allow you to grow on your
            own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, finding an artist mentor can be a little more complex,
            since many working artists and creatives work on their own at their
            own studios or creative shops
